# High Concept
A game where you dig up skeletons from the ground, throw them into a cauldron to resurrect them, and recruit them as allies to explore a dungeon.

# Core Gameplay Loop
The player wakes up on the first floor of a dungeon.
While exploring the dungeon, various events occur:
Unearth and resurrect skeletons to recruit party members.
Encounter monsters and engage in combat.
Discover equipment and relics.
Interact with NPCs and objects (e.g. shops, statues, traps).
Find the staircase leading down to descend to the next floor.
Defeat the final boss on the lowest floor to clear the game.

# Exploration System
Similar to Crypt of the NecroDancer, the player explores a tile-based, top-down 2D dungeon.
Tiles include empty spaces, obstacle tiles, item-bearing tiles like minerals, and traps.
All actions—digging, unlocking chests, removing obstacles—are bound to the movement input.
Similar to NecroKing or He is Coming, each move consumes a resource (e.g., food/hunger system, tentatively planned).

# Combat System
Combat triggers when the player enters the same tile as an enemy.
Uses a turn-based, automated combat system similar to He is Coming, where character and item effects resolve in order.
Each character has fixed passive and active skills. Turn order is determined by speed stat.
Like Darkest Dungeon, up to 4 characters are lined up in a row, facing up to 4 enemies.
There are no skills that hit specific ranks, but skills have maximum range and hit random targets within that range.
Character positioning is set during exploration and cannot be changed during combat.
If the protagonist dies, it’s an instant game over. Other characters leave behind corpses upon death (cannot be resurrected).

# Characters & Skills
Characters can exist in one of three states: resurrected, corpse, or skeleton.
The player and up to 3 other resurrected characters can be in the party at once (max 4).
Corpses cannot be carried. Skeletons can be carried if you have an urn item.
Each character has four base stats: HP, ATK, DEF, and SPD.
Characters also have a non-combat stat called affection, which influences events and dialogues.
Characters can equip one or more gear items.
Every character has at least one active skill; passive skills are optional.
Some characters are larger than 1 tile (e.g., golems, dragons take 2–3 spaces).

## Protagonist
If they die, it’s game over.
Must always be in the party.

## Human-Type Characters
High resurrection cost, low drop rate.
Overall higher stats than monster-types.
Includes both cute girls and thick, rugged middle-aged men.

## Monster-Type Characters
Low resurrection cost, high drop rate.
Overall lower stats than humans.
Includes goblins, slimes, red dragons, etc.

## Swapping Party Members
Kill the character: you can obtain the matching skeleton on that same floor in the next run.
Release the character: you can obtain the skeleton within ±1 floor range in the next run.
Sacrifice at an altar: you obtain the skeleton immediately.
Similar to Made in Abyss, after multiple runs the dungeon structure changes and skeletons no longer stack deeper.

# Equipment Items
Found in chests or purchased from merchants.
Only apply effects when equipped by a character.

# Relic Items
Function like relics in Slay the Spire — passive effects that apply broadly.
Found in chests or purchased from merchants.
Some relics have negative effects, like curses in Slay the Spire.
Cannot be removed once acquired.
